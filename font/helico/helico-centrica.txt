Helico Centrica is the illegitimate child of an encounter between a Blackletter font and a Geometric Sans Serif font.

It is suitable for display and graphic designs but not for long pieces of text.  I would not publish a book formatted in Helico Centrica but it would be suitable for chapter titles.

The font is released under the SIL Open Font License.

There are many Open Type Features, such as -

Capital Spacing
Many Case sensitive forms
Denominators
Many discretionary ligatures adding connections between characters
Fractions
Diacritic marks and fancy tails correctly positioned by anchors
Numerators
Oldstyle numbers
Ordinals
Small Capitals
Small Capitals from Capitals
Stylistic Set 1 swaps some of the capitals for more conventional capitals and also changes the style of the 'g'.
Stylistic Set 2 adds small flourishes to the Capitals and some of the lower case letters
Stylistic Set 3 adds different flourishes to many lower case characters
Stylistic Set 4 adds some different and more flamboyant flourishes to many lower case characters
Stylistic Set 5 adds some curly flourishes to some lower case characters mainly for use at the end of sentences
Stylistic Set 6 changes the zero into a dotted zero
Stylistic Set 7 changes the upper case 'CDILM' and 'X' into Roman Numerals
The Swash feature adds swashes to all upper case and some lower case characters
