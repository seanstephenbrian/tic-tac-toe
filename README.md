# [tic-tac-toe](https://seanstephenbrian.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)

this early javascript project is a simple **tic-tac-toe** browser game with a not-so-simple 
visual interface.

the script takes a modular approach, separating and grouping the various methods for starting, 
running, and ending the game, and for dynamically updating the DOM.

the visual aesthetic is experimental and unexpected, with flashing background graphics, backdrop 
filters, and hover effects, including randomized rotation of grid squares.
